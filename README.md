## Installation

### Cocoapods
STCubeTransition is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'STCubeTransition'
```
You want to add pod 'STCubeTransition', '~> 1.0' similar to the following to your Podfile:

```
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'STCubeTransition', '~> 1.0'
  use_frameworks!
end
```
Then run a pod install inside your terminal, or from CocoaPods.app.

Alternatively to give it a test run, run the command:

```
pod try STCubeTransition
```
### Manual
- Drag and drop `STCubeTransition.swift` class into your project in Xcode.
- Make sure you select all the targets required.

## Usage

It is much simpler than performing an UIView animation. 

If you use `Cocoapods`, First of all, import the framework:

```
import STCubeTransition
```

Then, init `CubeTransition` with delegate as follows,

```
let cubeTranstion:CubeTransition = CubeTransition()
cubeTranstion.delegate = self
```

next, perform cube transition between your views as follows,

```
cubeTranstion.translateView(faceView: self.faceView!,   // currently visible view
                            withView: subMenu!,         // hidden view that you want to display from this transition
                            toDirection: direction,     // any available CubeTransitionDirection
                            withDuration: 0.5)          // animation duration
```

Finally, implement the `CubeTransitionDelegate` optional method if you would like to perform any additional actions,

```
func animationDidFinishWithView(displayView: UIView) {
        // Do any additional work if required
    }
```

Here you go you are all setup for performing cool Cube Transition in you app üëç
